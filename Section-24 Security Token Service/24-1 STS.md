# AWS STS - Security Token Service

* Allows to grant **limited** temporary access to AWS resources (up to 1 hour)
* `AssumeRole` - assume roles within your account or **cross account**
* `AssumeRoleWithSAML` - return credentials for users **logged with SAML**
* `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` - return credentials for users logged with IDP - **(Facebook Login, Google Login)**
* `GetSessionToken` - For **MFA**, from users or aws account root user
* `GetFederationToken` - obtain temporary creds for a **federated user**
* `GetCallerIdentity` - return **details about the IAM user or role used** in the API call
* `DecodeAuthorizationMessage` - decode error message when an AWS API is denied

## STS with MFA
* Use `GetSessionToken` from STS
* `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent: true`

## Advanced IAM
* If theres and explicit DENY, end decision will be DENY
* If theres an ALLOW, end decision with ALLOW
* Else DENY

## IAM Policies & S3 Bucket Policies
* IAM policies are attached to user, roles, groups
* S3 Bucket Polices are attached to buckets
* When evaluating an IAM principal can perform an operation on a bucket
  - The **Union** of it's assigned IAM polices and S3 Bucket Policies will be evaluated
  - IAM Policy + S3 Bucket Policy = Total Policy Evaluated

## Dynamic Policies with IAM
* How do you assign each user a `/home/<user>/folder` in S3 Bucket?
  * Create one dynamic policy with IAM
  * Leverage the special policy variable `${aws:username}`

* Example:
  ```
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder",
      "Action": ["s3:*"],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3::my-company/home/${aws:username}/*"]    
  ```

  ## Inline vs Manage Policies
  * Managed Policy
    * maintained by AWS
    * Good for power users and administrators
    * Updated in case of new services / new APIs
  
  * Customer Manged Policy
    * Best Practice, re-useable can be applied to many principals
    * Version Controlled + rollback central change management
  
  * Inline
    * Strict one-to-one relationship between policy and principal
    * Policy is deleted if you delete the IAM principal
    * Policies are attached to the user
    * User policy also have limit of 2kb

  ## Directory Services
    * AWS Managed Microsoft AD
      * create your own AD in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA
      * Establish trust connectoons with your on premise AD
    
    * AD Connector
      * Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on premise AD
      * Users are managed on the on-premise AD

    * Simple AD
      * AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
      * Cannot be joined with on-premise AD


## Sample Question
An EC2 instance has an IAM instance role attached to it, providing it read and write access to the S3 bucket "my_bucket". You have tested the IAM instance role and both reads and writes are working. You then remove the IAM role from the EC2 instance and test both read and write again. Writes stopped working but Reads are still working. What is the likely cause of this behavior?

**Ans** The S3 bucket policy auhorizes read
---------------------------------------------
What's this IAM policy allowing you to do?

```
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Secret Policy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "EC2",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Passrole",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam:::role/RDS-*"
        }
    ]
}
```
**Ans**: 
Allowing you to assign IAM roles to EC2 if they start with "RDS-"
